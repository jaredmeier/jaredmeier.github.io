When I lean in, I feel it cool my face, but there is the warmth of the salt and the gentleness of the depth of the ocean.
made of dripping, salty 
A food that has been planted deep within my brain, with all of its juiciness and saltiness.
I think part of the reason I don't write about these places is that, while yes I am always so excited to stop, so excited about stepping out of my car, walking into an oddly shaped building brimming with families of strangers all ravaged by highway travel, while I like this part so much, my mood tends to dip quite a bit once I've gone through the restroom and I've stood in line for my fastfood sandwich, and it is at that point, after I've successfully paid for said sandwich, that my eyes, once bright with the excitement of arrival and relief and salt, now narrow on the exit as I stride, each step longer than the last, past the strangers just now entering the oddly shaped building, through the doors, into the humid air, then back into my personal automobile haven.
