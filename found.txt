Or the new place for the mousetrap -- behind the bottom drawer of the stove, tucked next to a nicely made bed of white insulation.
The mouse didn't smell danger, it smelled cheese.
I think it's because of the things that haunt me right now -- I saw a mouse; I had covid exposure; I must read a play.
Oh yes, my, the mouse has been caught!
The mouse's blood (it was cut like ribbons) has spread on the floor and in it I can see words -- they summarize the play!
And if I know my left from my right, my yawn from my dawn, my swiss army knife from my muesli spoon -- if I know how to start a fire in a swamp, how to tilt the odds in a game of cat and mouse, how to say that's just how life is and mean it in a good way, then I do know this: The Moon is looking fine tonight.
It sounded like a mouse, and I suspected as much, rampant as they were in most of the small, dark places in the house, and increasingly the lit, open places, too.
I didn't want to hit the mouse with a pot after I found it squealing in a glue trap.
I had to put the mouse and the trap into a plastic grocery bag so that I couldn't see it.
My mouse lights up.
But when it's dark, when I am trying to sleep, then that is when I hate this mouse.
Mouse oh mouse, who has awoken you?
Small white mouse.
