Metal water in a water glass!
It is solid water, not watery at all.
I grab the sides of the fridge and do my best to jerk it back and forth, shaking the shelves next to it that hold pots, pans, mixing bowls, tools, junk that never found another home (a chess board, watercolors, face masks).
If I found fire I would warm the water that washes my face, though my weasel skin would not need the same routine of hygiene.
Speaking of mice, it could have been the rats, the ones that flow over the bags of trash like water over rocks.
I think I wanted to twist my familiarity around a strange pole I've lowered into the icy lake water.
It must be if I am here, lowering this strange pole into its waters.
A few years ago I made my first sketch of the train, and now, I can hold up the piece of paper, and move my eyes from every detail I dreamt to the real thing stretching out before me -- the extra-wide, extra-high smoke stack, the ornate cattle pusher, the caboose painted purple with sky-blue sailboats (I wish to sail, but no one here knows how to swim, and we've decided the water is off-limits for anything but staring at from a safe distance).
Someone else dips the top of their head in and slicks back their hair; another waves a bandana back and forth through the water and then slaps it over the back of their neck.
I found myself alone with a fish, nowhere near water, as far as I could tell.
I fell to my knees and there was a splash, wetness -- I had been standing still in still water.
Who do I ask about this body of water?
The next day she looked out the window at a puddle in the courtyard and said quietly, "stagnant water." 
Stagnant water, or a puddle from the thunderstorm that will be gone by the end of the day?
Long close-up shots of the three mens' heads and faces, long shots of them lying on the ground, talking sleepily about desire, selfishness, long shots of water and trees and light shifting.
Shifting to a pedestrian desire, cold metal on thighs, cold water in mouth, open window rain patter.
I think this happened in the shower as I felt the hot water melt the muscles in my neck, as I smelled the floral soap, the eucalyptus, and listened to music.
From the occasional sob, the frequent watering, and the persistent glaze, and yet also from being continuously dry.
Like the water bottle, like the hard drive, like the desire.
You'll need to find a way to make your straw a bit longer, the water runs deeper it's true, but its top, its surface, follows it down, like lowering the bottom of a cup, like shoving a tree deeper into the ground.
They die of responsibility, the weight on their shoulders dragging them deep into the water.
They're good swimmers, of course, because they are healthy, but they haven't much figured out floating, or haven't figured out the need to float, that no one can swim forever in such deep waters, especially not when being dragged down deeper and deeper.
A house that burned down on the coldest day of the winter, the water from the hoses freezing and melting, freezing and melting, cyclically, now shafts of ice, tan from the smoke, hanging from the ceiling or reaching from the floor.
the fish caught the drift and died, knowing nothing but that their home was always going to be a non-permanent sort of situation, a non-secure home, temporary, drifting, drifting off, drifting away, shimmering one day, maybe like water one day, maybe like oil the next
Lilac-infused water
Pineapple-infused-lilac-infused water
I've had three glasses of water in the moments since you told me I should be more careful about what I eat and when.
I imagined strokes of colors, like watercolors.
It took me around, and it left me 4 avocados, a thing of mustard, and a bag of dill seeds richer, but the whole time it was guiding me home, back to my captors, smooth interiors and entertainment, cold, fizzy juices, regenerating supplies of ice and water - filtered for drinking, pressurized for cleaning - conditioned air, all of my favorite books, movies, games, and songs, acoustic and electronic instruments, an abundance of soft surfaces, drugs,  alcohol, and tobacco, direct connections to every single person I know and do not know, fresh meats and cheeses and seasonal vegetables and fruit, various grains, beans, nuts, oils, coffee, supplies and tools for creating with pencils, paints, words, dozens of opportunities for live voyeurism, and any number of additional goods and services on demand for impossibly fast delivery.
And after the alarm-raising phrases "hey underwater boy" and "hey underwater girl" are thrown out from the bleachers we do in fact have to stop playing hockey for the rest of the year.
I'll drink glass after glass of water, and I'll slowly get less thirsty, so goes the legend.
My water is too cold.
Were there a garbage disposal, I'd put them there and grind them into the water.
Pot of ocean water and the thick smells of dead fish cooked too long, went too far inland, a jumbo spoon in a stew of currents.
On this rooftop I will sing my song about the people and the flowers, on this ledge I will look down and across and see the water and see the boats and the flowers down the avenue.
A narrative channel, a gulley filled with some moving water I think, but also lots of debris.
We were a family restaurant for those leaving the zoo, a respite for those fleeing their families at the zoo, and a watering hole for the local alcoholics who came in every morning with newspapers, smiles, and shaking hands, for the large man who we called "the Godfather," who was impressed that I knew Django Reinhardt and once asked me to tie his shoe.
The water is on, the bowl is empty, no one sits there or someone sits on the floor, the shirt is on the ground, the mail disappears or never comes.
If I could, I'd stretch my face across the head of a rocket and launch aimless save for up, my eyes watering, my teeth rattling, in the intensity of the wind through the layers of the atmosphere, a shocking cold within a wide, warm, bright blare of sun.
These winds surged the eastern waters of Lake Erie; the waves built mounds of ice larger than houses and pushed them slowly toward the neighborhoods on the shore.
Maybe it's something in the water.
We will drink water from glasses that haven't been washed in days and are covered in lip smudges.
an underwater shark roar) as I placed my Aeropress upon it and measured out four careful tablespoons of freshly ground coffee.
I have my chapstick, my coffee, my glass of water, my phone, my computer, my slippers, my Brian Eno, my lamp, my ideas of breakfast, my groggy ideas of nothing, my stubborn slide into work.
Clear waters.
We need water.
Then I had a soccer game, and now today, Wednesday September 19th, my body is sore and, while noticing that Joe managed to single-handedly go through a whole package of paper towels while I was gone and cursing such overuse, I grabbed the stovetop burner cage thing, the one for the burner I had just used to heat my water for my coffee.
My cup of coffee was almost gone, so I poured in more hot water.
