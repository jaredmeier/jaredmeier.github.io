   * Often felt very similar to the sensation I have when falling asleep, when I am able to retain some lucidity alongside the other part of the mind that is entering a dream state full of bizarre connections and illogical constructions
It is a strange dream.
I dream of home improvements -- a lamp in the corner, a rack for pots and pans on the far wall of the kitchen, the kinds of window shades you can pull down and pull up and see through enough.
It made their teeth rattle, their dreams bitter.
If you are dead dreams on the pillow.
I thought for a while, but it all went away, like a dream on eyes opened.
With a hint of dreams I will bleed gold.
(It goes without saying why.) Upon waking I allow myself no more than three recollections of the dreams from the night before, and only one rumination thereof.
I've slept in the bed that sweats my nights into late mornings, sunken into terrible dreams that are yet weightless and preferred.
A few years ago I made my first sketch of the train, and now, I can hold up the piece of paper, and move my eyes from every detail I dreamt to the real thing stretching out before me -- the extra-wide, extra-high smoke stack, the ornate cattle pusher, the caboose painted purple with sky-blue sailboats (I wish to sail, but no one here knows how to swim, and we've decided the water is off-limits for anything but staring at from a safe distance).
This is a dream.
It must be a dream.
Dreamt 373 dreams (naps always make dreams)
I dream of streets with geysers, haunted houses.
I dream of falling asleep in a room where I find in the corner a haunted absence.
I dream of my friend's parents diving into a glacial lake after swerving around the bison that mosey the road we take toward something I really don't understand.
In these dreams I find old friends who have come to guide me, who stay long enough for me to question if I love them, if I trust them enough to keep them around.
I think of my dreams of graduation, which I have every six months or so.
Our dreams and nightmares are flavors of the same thing.
our dreams taste like delicious nightmares
I dream in fortune and color,
We returned to the house and got in our PJs and went to sleep and now we dream, I think.
I will sleep heavily, but my dreams will be of the occult, of chasing and being chased, of fraught confrontations with strangers and old friends, of inventions of food and music and baby names, of creatures that love me, of employers who despise me, of lovers who are always some distance away.
I had a dream that I had two kids.
In sleep, how many directions do my dreams go in before they land at the same spots?
Honeybee dreams, flying out, collecting sweet pollen, returning for work.
I dream of having honey on oatmeal, honey in my tea, paper flapping in the breeze, the shuffle of feet down hallways, up stairs.
Can't wish for a dream.
Your dreams wish for you.
Here, amongst the grandeur, built in turn by God and by Man, I will take chances I cannot dream of here in my miniscule, Elite East Coast Life.
From searching the backs of the eyelids for comfort from the anxiety in the nightly dreams of massive distances churning and bellowing between other people and other places and myself.
The cars in my dreams drive around on the highways forever.
I have been stepping on the edges of steps late at night so that my feet slide rather than plop down the building stairwell as I go outside to smoke cigarettes and watch the rats run back and forth between their homes and the sidewalk piles of trash, grabbing used paper towels and food scraps, recycling in ways we only dream of.
I will dream of making soup.
Dan am the unfilled details in dreams.
They're really living up their dreams, of playing until their dying day.
I dreamt I was covered in yellow bruises with stretched amoeba-like shapes, shapes like blobs in lava lamps.
I slept with ear plugs in until the early morning when I pulled them out, thinking in my half asleep state that they were making my dreams too vivid and I just needed some rest; I didn't need dreams, I needed rest.

* * @HannahElliott You fly in your dreams?
I love that feeling but haven't had one of those dreams in a long time ☹️"
of what I dreamt the other night?
Clipping news sounds for my dream airs
What a dream.
I had a series of dreams, interrupted by alarms (but always continuing roughly where they left off), that I went back to school.
What a dream.
Actually this is the second time I've had a dream in a few days about moving into a new place in New England.
I listened to it into the morning, as I dreamt, it was pushing against the walls, trying to keep moving and moving and moving.
I can only dream of
Like when you have a sex dream about someone you don't really like, but then you feel weird for a few days afterward when you think about them.
I have dreamed of making lists:
I had a dream that bugs were crawling all over me.
The big tree outside sways alternatingly violently and gently, and I dream of toast.
Right before I did, I had a dream that I was in a coffee shop Googling "difficulty waking up even with lots of sleep," and I remember some results were about getting exercise.
You won't dream of knowing her.
