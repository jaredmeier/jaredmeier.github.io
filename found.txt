With my phone-camera the moon is a blurry triplicate.
I wish for a day, for a night, for a moon.
The ones that hide, the ones that dance, the ones that take off for the moon.
Face like the moon, which always shows the same side to us -- it'd be boring if we looked more closely.
Whether lost, found, owned by me or owned by a man on the moon, they're mostly worthless, regardless.
Up above me, once again, sits the moon.
Earlier on my run through the park, hours after the sun had set, while moving from one glow of a lamplight to the next, I saw the moon across the baseball fields, peeking over the top of the woods, its face bright orange.
At this point my patience wore thin -- not because I can't handle more than one joke in a row, but because I knew this one would also be hard for me to understand, I was still out of breath, and besides, I've never enjoyed the moon's jokes before anyway.
I am at the bottom of the sea on the moon.
From my bed, now, I see a sliver of a pale yellow moon, or pieces of it, through the branches of a tree and who knows what else.
I will wake early and see the moon between the curtains or I will wake later and see the sun come in through the bathroom window.
Why is the moon sometimes yellow?
You see when it lifts its shirt to wipe its sweaty face that the moon has a six-pack now.
You can't remember seeing the moon working out recently.
The moon's got a six-pack now.
Around the moon's abs the lobster crawls, pinching its claws in the air in some sort of celebration, likely of the moon's new abs.
Everyone's your friend when you're the moon.
Everyone's your pet when you're the moon.
Depends on the moon, just like many other things.
All lobsters depend on the moon, for instance.
Not just the ones that are pets (to the moon or otherwise), but all the wild ones, too, and all the one waiting to be eaten.
They are the ones who need the oceans, who need the tides, who need the moon.
Yes, the wild lobsters need the moon.
The wild lobsters need the moon, and they should be the ones celebrating the moon's abs.
Forget the moon's abs.
Forget the moon entirely.
Let the moon be on its own.
You wave goodbye to the moon and wonder what it will look like the next time you see it -- briefly, you wonder briefly, until you forget it, whatever it was.
First I look at the moon and then I look at the city.
The moon is in the same spot it was last night.
I mean, not just because of how old I am, not really that, it's easy to never look at the moon let alone understand or even track its movements from one day to the next -- no, not that, but because I worked on a space game for more than six years.
I should know how the moon moves.
Like in the moon pilot's nightmare?
During a blackout you hope for a full moon.
Jupiter's moon knows our secrets.
On Jupiter's moon Europa we will find the reason why an octopus will uncharacteristically touch another octopus while on MDMA, why this is what we do, too.
