   * I occasionally opened my eyes, as I did last time, and felt a similar "in space" feeling, but I was not very interested in it
   * Multiple times I imagined a video that was POV approaching a man who was lying down with eyes closed, and there was some slightly off-putting feeling, until the camera got very close to him and it became clear he was very quietly laughing
maybe a little older?) and having a dental mold created, which involved having a mouth full of a clay-like material for a very long time, and I could breathe only through my mouth, and I was praised for being extremely patient and calm, though of course it was a very unpleasant experience
It zoomed out from the direct experience and started identifying the setting: where I was, what my body was doing and how it felt, who was there, where others were, what time it was, what would happen in the future, etc.
At one point, fairly early on, it occurred to me to ask, "So what am I doing here?" I realized I was in a place and that I had time and space to wander.
In each instance, though, something seemed to prevent me from spending enough time with the questions, from getting closer to answers.
I come to you now in this thick bush of time: What has happened?
On Sunday, she ran a 5k with me and Bryan, her "running buddies." A few times she wanted to walk, but with some light convincing, she continued on running.
Two times.
I was a mummy lost in a spaceless place outside of time, or lost in time, or in all of spacetime.
It's told like a story that has been told before, that has been told many times.
By the time the buzz of the fridge cuts through the resting noises of the room, it is deafening.
It's peculiar how you've spent so much time talking about that one thing, and so little time talking about so many others.
But I didn't have time.
Or I didn't think I'd have time.
I've thought they've smelled the same for some time now.
So it is a jump to a time, and a layer on top.
I continue to try to grasp the agility and strength of strings of words, their ability to heave time around, not heave, it is much simpler, to shuffle time like a deck of cards, their ability to cram concepts into the same place, with a sort of violence in the movement, but there is no resistance, these things have never resisted, and there is no ill will, and it is not an ill act, then maybe not a violence but a swiftness…?
It moves instantaneously between time and between place.
On most repetitions I time it correctly so I can cross from the ice cream shop diagonally to the juice bar (and vice-versa) as the traffic switches, but sometimes I find myself dodging through the intersection more than I'd like.
Is it time to update my journal?
Is it time to stomp?
But truth be told, I'm having a hard time imagining how big the other chunk would be, and so without the full picture I'm not able to get the fractions right.
These ceramic shards have no answers for me, they are just a reminder of the havoc I cause, of the blood I draw, of the ugliness that surfaces in the mirror every time I am around.
No predators, just time.
It emits, unwaveringly, the soft mechanical sound of a motor, a soft, rhythmic thump each time around.
Other people were allowed to grow older in this time, and that meant allowing change, and allowing for a recognition of individual growth and individual lives.
Sure, pillows sometimes support things other than heads, but we can all agree that heads are primarily what they support, and without the need for this, well.
I've lived long enough to be forgotten by you multiple times.
This is painful this time.
There was the time I decided that I should finally, after years of ignoring my dentist and then years of not having a dentist to even ignore, try to floss a couple times a week, and on the very first night, on the very first crevice explored, out popped a tooth.
They said they'd love to hear my opinion if I was willing to give them a few minutes of my time.
I'd make friends with the stars, who will not only guide me but tell me soothing bedtime stories.
I went to step around him and that's when he asked me, wariness in his voice, if I knew what time it was.
I did not stop, but I pulled my phone from my pocket and read the time to him: "Almost 7." Curious enough to see what this man's next move would be upon hearing the time, I glanced back.
It's hard for me to imagine a more perfect time to feel the pull of a massive knot in my shoulder than right this instant.
It is the best possible time for such an immense feeling.
It's the only time it makes sense to do it.
Right when I am getting sleepy, that is the time I must accomplish my goals.
And they of course have their allotted times and amounts, as any good diet does.
I must note that at this time of day, I keep things light.
We find it a waste of time to introduce ourselves.
Yes, I will sometimes say goodbye before I've said a single hello.
It is brought to you by all time preceding.
There's no time.
But, ya know, sometimes kids when they have a cast on for a while, on one of their limbs, they'll grow really thick hair there, or ya know, it's something you'll see once the cast comes off -- a real hairy arm, or leg.
I'm not expecting to stumble upon anything more than what I've already found at my feet a million times before.
I've flipped the direction of my lamb skin that I put on my pillow, I suspect I've had it in one direction for a very long time now and the bottom of it (or, now, the top) has started to become very worn.
I've had a focused mind for a few hours, and now it is time for it to release.
I do this thing sometimes where, if I'm doing something incorrectly, I'll notice it and fret over it and want to fix it, and I'll even make some attempt at fixing it, but I won't do quite enough to actually change anything, or change enough.
One time it led me to run over a series of small trees on a lawnmower.
One time it led me to throwing out every important piece of paper I had been keeping for years.
One time I insulted not just every student in the class, but every professor, every person who had ever stepped foot on campus.
One time, a long time, stretching across years, I found myself deeper and deeper underground.
It's true that when I got out of bed this morning I leaned my head out the window and I said to the grey sky, "You're on a roll today, sport." And it's true that upon doing so the grey sky cracked open, just slightly, just in one of the many hundreds of its corners, peeled open, really, and one incredibly long finger descended slowly -- but only slow relative to its size, it being so terribly long it covered vast distances in no time at all, and soon the tip of it was at my nose, hovering, I could see dirt beneath the nail, and before I could protest or even flinch the finger was up my nose and I thought to myself, "Oh what a day to be picked." 
I know it may it seem like these words have been plucked deliberately from the patches, but the truth is that I have not in a long time been careful with my words, I have not taken the time to choose an appropriate word, much less the right word.
When it's time to go.
It often wakes up crying in the middle of the night, and the researchers have a hell of a time getting it back to sleep, if any of them even bother to try.
I usually stay for a night or two, because I can barely stand it, but I have no good reason to visit in the first place, much less stay for any period of time, so it feels both unusually short and unusually long.
Why would I waste my time on such empty philosophies?
Every time my wheel has inched off in the past, inched toward the bottom of the ditch, my impulse has been to correct it back onto the road, which is not the best thing to do.
This is long enough for me to safely time a venture, but every time I've started to make a move, from across the floor their laughter roars and I am knocked back into my chair.
Until the next time I did it and the rod crumpled and my full weight crashed into the window.
Ah, I really did bork it this time, with my reliance on writing late at night.
There is sometimes no meaning behind anything.
I've set the timer and walked off the set, you could say!
Maybe I have been hallucinating for a long time.
Or for a short time that has felt, within the hallucination, to be an eternity.
The cart before the horse happened because of time.
Before speaks of where it will go, will go speaks of a later time.
It's not that there are fewer thoughts in my brain, fewer feelings, it's that I haven't been looking, haven't been feeling, or if I have, I haven't spent time with them, haven't talked to them, haven't listened.
effect) that I do not spend time with my thoughts, and so I do not have thoughts, and so I do not think to have thoughts.
Sometimes, when I leave the restaurant at night, I will walk around the block before heading home, and it's possible they would have seen me then.
The thought occurs to me that if I do this ritual walk not at night but as I am doing now, in the middle of the day, maybe there would be fewer shadows, or smaller shadows, and I could look around at the people, as I have just done, and maybe one time, after doing this many times, I could recognize someone and they could recognize me, and I could tell them to come order a hamburger.
Said, "Wait, what just happened?" 38 times
Quit my job 0 times
Every time I imagine the shape of my mind, there is a clear sense of it.
But I disagree with this completely because I have seen time and time again that I can start writing answers when I don't have any questions, and somehow they can begin to define each other simultaneously.
I have lost my guarantees on the passage of time again.
One time he stared directly at me while typing his password as I held my hand in front of my face to block my view of the keyboard, and watched as he typed into the username field "jaredisdumb".
One of them I still think of occasionally, and I think of him as a friend, think of him as a friendly person, even later in life when we wouldn't spend so much time together but would still see each other occasionally -- I think of this friend and all of the pain he caused me.
Sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly, but always by doing some really stupid shit.
One day in middle school (I was in 7th, he in 9th) we were in his unfinished basement where we spent much of our time, and as was the habit now after too many incidents of broken bulbs, each of which was met with less and less forgiveness from his parents, he was using a hand towel to unscrew the lightbulbs that sat exposed in the beams.
I trim my fingernails the moment I feel them extending beyond the fleshy end of my finger as I place my thumb successively on each fingertip, a ritual I complete absentmindedly many times every hour.
If I feel more nail than skin, I know that it is time to trim.
Yeah well I've lived around here since 1982, and I can tell you that I've seen this sort of thing happen a dozen times, at least.
This time I knew.
I counted every day since last time I wrote.
I know that they are always -- (almost always, there are times when each thought is grasped desperately, searched for potential, for meaning, for appeal) -- they are almost always moving silently.
And so clearly in these moments I see how there are bigger thoughts, there are feelings which lead to bigger (zoomed out) thoughts all the time.
I said I would finish that tale another time.
We had been skating for around 30 minutes and it seemed like a good time to take a break for a drink.
But not yet, we'll go around a few more times.
Let me finish this tale another time.
Sometimes it alarms you, how large it looks, how much energy it must contain.
Sometimes you grab it, knead it like dough, shake it like a dog with a rabbit, feel its life.
Sometimes you exhale deeply and place your fingertips lightly around it, a traveler tracing the shapes of wildly different worlds across a globe.
If I sat at my home in Connecticut and watched as the lights went out in the houses across the street would I write a story to pass the time?
I feel miserable and I think of the people in my life, and of the people online, who say they are miserable all of the time.
I have not been miserable all of the time.
There is an app that at some point during the calendar day, it asks everyone, at the same time, to take a picture + selfie combo.
because I travel time
I guess I could go sit outside in the meantime.
If I didn't live in a city, I still wouldn't have time to go on long hikes on normal days.
This is my freewriting time.
Sometimes the second impulse never comes, but usually it does, and here it is the decision to insert the correction into your choice of words, casually letting it roll out into the conversation so that the offender catches it and recognizes their error, but does not know whether it was from a pedantic impulse or merely a reflection of knowledge.
The feeling rattled me, though, obviously, and after I was able to lie back down it took me a long time again to fall asleep.
I think it was actually the second time I woke up, having woken up earlier, around 4, having some sort of anxiety at that point, too, but mostly just feeling stirred by something invisible, and then continuing to be prodded by this for an hour or so.
Sometimes I address that feeling by going for a run, which resets me a bit, releases some of the anxiety, pushes out stuck thoughts and lets new ones in, but lately I have had the fear that a run is not long enough, not the ones I do, which even if I stretch out with a walk in the middle (which I really like), last about 45 minutes.
Sometimes I don't know why I'm writing this, though.
We were both drunk and it was very late by the time she arrived, and she wondered out loud if it was a mistake, if the stirring was too painful and not worth it, if it would only lead to more pain for both of us.
It reeks of life he had said, and explained that he felt uneasy with the abundance of odors that came our way as we walked -- slowly at first, but increasingly quickly -- through the more heavily wooded section near the center of the park, along the stream where sometimes people would sit, staring, and turn cautiously to look at you as you passed.
The next time I saw him, he had removed all of his hair.
It did begin with a mention of wood, specifically that there was a strong sentiment in the town against bringing in wood from outside of the area, due to issues with pests and disease -- and this did of course seem relevant to chopping wood -- but then it took a long detour into a maze of thoughts about the townspeople and the whirl of nonsensical rumors that apparently had been tearing through the area that summer -- three summers ago.
It was soothing despite also being unsettling much of the time.
Maybe because of that real zinger of a last line (inspiration while doing what I like to do now after work, go for a run to the park, then walk around for a bit, then run back -- that time of walking,  in between running, in the park, with nothing but my watch with me, is chef's kiss).
Instead of pushing me to expand on the details of the introspection I offer, she asks me questions that sometimes I can't even see the point of answering, the response I and any other person would give is so obvious -- but there's the challenge: breaking down the baseline assumptions, questioning the things that aren't usually questioned, asking if they can be looked at more closely, from different angles.
Before his 4-day trip to Portland, he asks you to pick him up from the airport on his return, and he neglects to remind you of this during his time away.
Are you to remember not just the favor, but the time and day as well?
You find the text with the details, then you text him what time again?, as a reminder that your schedule is flexible but still planned, and that you have other important things to remember.
Half a year later, he asks you to pick him up from the airport again, and this time he reminds you the day before.
Sometimes unwittingly but more importantly often intentionally, you hide in your casual conversations with new acquaintances quizzes on matters important to you, holding correct answers as price of admission, and wrong ones as grounds for dismissal.
You sit in the back of the car and we can hear nothing that you say -- you insist it is not important, this we hear, every time.
I think it's especially interesting because I know this feeling was not limited to just the short time in which I felt its immensity.
Both of these stemming from me telling my therapist that I had recently talked to Julia and told her I needed time and space, because my feelings lately have only intensified and dug their heels in even deeper.
How many times have I felt that before during this whole grieving process?
It has been so long but I just want you to know that I worked for a long time tonight on the alien story.
It took time and concerted effort to change this, as I had done it the same way for 20-something years.
But these assurances are always temporary: over time, they erode under the mightier force of uncertainty.
Okay, so today I saw Julia for the first time since she left for Germany.
You remember that time, right?
Ah, yes, that time.
Oh, and this is the thought I had in the shower now after subscribing to an OnlyFans account for the first time out of some satanic mixture of curiosity and horniness.
But I don't think now is the time so say them.
Always a good time to wade in.
I have been experiencing pain at times.
Most of the time.
There was indeed something freeing about knowing that for some time it was not possible, thousands of miles separated us.
How many of my beliefs will I no longer believe in by the time this sentence ends?
I should have the fan on a 20-minute timer.
Sometime within the past few years I stopped fearing I would become my father.
The last time I spoke to her I told her I didn't want to hear any more about her new job teaching alien children, and that's when she started telling me how delicious she finds those alien raspberries.
I have a soothing cream (alien-made) that helps considerably, but I just know that if any of my relationships start to get more intimate and I start spending more time with someone -- whether human or alien, though I imagine I won't be able to get anywhere with an alien, they are so beautiful -- if they start sleeping over, it won't be long before I'm hit with a nighttime urge that I'm unable to turn away from, and I'll sneak out and find an ear of alien corn, returning only when I've gone too far, when my face is raw and oozing, and I'll put on my stinky soothing cream and slide back into bed, and they'll turn over and touch my face, I'll wince but remain silent in my shame, and they'll say, "How could you do this to yourself?
Who is writing me emails at this time?
Sometimes I pull myself along the rope.
I think it just says "burger" a dozen times.
I have a cream (human-made) that helps considerably, but I just know that if any of my relationships start to get more intimate and I start spending more time with someone, they start sleeping over, it won't be long before I'm faced with a nighttime urge that I'm unable to turn away from, and I'll sneak out and find an ear of alien corn, returning only when I've gone too far, when my face is raw and oozing, and I'll put my stinky cream on and slide back into bed, and they'll turn over and touch my face, I'll wince but remain silent in my shame, and they'll say, "How could you do this to yourself?
I don't like standing here for all of this time.
I think time is a rubber band and it's going to snap any second.
I will frame two rabbits this time.
But that's the last time I'll apologize.
I set the timer to countdown an unclear amount of time.
There are no markings, and I cannot measure its progress without another timer.
the times I felt I could not walk 
the times I felt this walk
The trick is that sometimes when I start writing after midnight I still mark the date as the day before.
It's when I opened my eyes -- that is time that is important.
I try not to put anything in the way of the horse that I have climbed but sometimes I find that I've wandered into thick woods anyway, just because I think they look nice and relaxing.
I can't say I don't feel it as well, all the time.
I will rise to occasions that have been carved by more money and by more time than the cheap, new inventions found in these cities and on these beaches.
Planes will bring in revelers, not businessmen, though sometimes former businessmen.
but I know that every time I pass by this spot, I will think of this rat, and I will think of its unbridled love for those crispy lil crusts.
It was a Facetime call, but both of us were hidden in the dark of our unlit rooms.
I remember at first I was conscious of my breaths, of hers, hanging onto the last of the sounds I knew I would hear from her for a long time.
From darting around Julia's social media, looking for the changes from the last time they noticed changes.
I want to get at the idea that honesty is time sensitive.
Or rather, being honest is time sensitive.
And each time it burns, I throw it down on the ground and walk away, cursing this ball of clay as I search for a new ball of clay, because I like clay, and I know that clay does not burn, does not spontaneously catch on fire, cannot hurt me.
I had been living with Sam for 3 years, but each year we moved, sometimes into apartments with other roommates.
We were close friends, but built by time and shared experience, not intimacy or communication.
You can make time linear.
You can put a limit on the back of your head and make problems bounce around a little bit more but for a shorter amount of time.
We try to dust off words, as though they have a pure shine underneath that has not been touched by the grimy hands of writers and speakers through time, we try to break them down, as though they have a form that is atomic and powerful.
Moving from fall they change in appearance, and then stop changing, and then sway until it is time to start changing again.
How C's opinion of D changes over time only due to C's own changes, allowing for seeing D in a new light.
C liked D overall, but at the time, it wasn't uncommon for C to find D bossy and arrogant.
And each time he sits with the sentence long enough to hate it.
Well this time I have an answer.
I suppose another issue is that sometimes I will fall asleep when in the process of collecting donations.
If I happen to collect an organ, which has happened a handful of times, against all odds, it does not end up in the hands of anyone who needs it.
I could text everyone at the same time, in the same group thread.
allowing you precious time to move and articulate
Sometimes I could not sleep because of the feeling of an object of immensity too large too feel.
Sometimes this feeling felt good, like I was connecting to everything, and other times it felt terrible, like everything was about to be nothing.
Maybe she, too, doesn't want to admit to the terrible feelings that crawl out of unexpected places at unexpected times.
first time.
This time when I heard barking, I stood up, but continued to watch whatever show I was watching.
He's just barking again, this happens all the time.
This also happened all the time.
The first time, when I went back to watch, this other dog, not yet dead, kneeled down into the pit my dad had dug and seemed excited and confused about why our other dog was down there.
a moment of shame: when the woman drawing my blood tells me a story about the time her friend was feeding some swans, and they were so huge, you realize this when you get close to them, and I, without wonder, say "yeah swans can get really big"
Not with any real flavor, but at least on time with the music.
Return to me the parts of myself that are hidden behind numbers, behind numbers changing over time.
Smart watch, show me time.
And yes, you may be thinking, when's the last time I've seen bench seating in a minivan?, but you'd be surprised.
It's true, I may be older and come from a different time when bench seating in a minivan was the norm, but in my line of work I see the interiors of many different vehicles, many of which are minivans.
Now if I had more time on my hands I would take a closer look at that minivan and determine the make and model and reach into the catalogue of vehicles I have in my memory to determine which type of seating it in fact has, but as you know, we have a situation on our hands, and it's time for you to make a decision on how you're going to merge.
I encourage you to keep your hands on 9 and 3 -- by the way, great job on keeping up with the latest recommendations from NHTSA, you wouldn't believe how many people get in here and immediately go for 10 and 2 -- yes, keep your hands there for as long as you can, but once we hit that car -- or minivan -- your instinct will be to let go and raise your hands, trust me I've seen it a dozen times, this instinct to protect the head during a crash -- But no, that's the last thing you want to do.
I always forget to bring a carry-on-size-appropriate bottle of contact solution, so I leave them in, and by the time I've landed, or even by the time we hit the central plains, when I'm typically awake after my initial sleep and am browsing the catalogue of movies and drinks -- by this time, my contacts feel like small sheets of paper stuck to jello cubes.
Just like the few other times before.
How could little Runfie not feel that absence o' ground, that mighty wind that comes up the cliffs this time o' year?
Little Runfie must have been lost in thought, again, just like the few times before.
Why is the moon sometimes yellow?
This is the first time I've worn a baseball cap in March.
This isn't an appropriate time.
Get caught with your pants down at the turn of one month and you become so vigilant, or maybe paranoid, that you stop time in its track, stop everything from moving, everything from happening, with your one watchful, spiteful eye.
I climbed back into bed and Googled things about carbon monoxide detector false alarms, believing as I did the night before that there were no possible sources for this and that the only explanation was that, as had happened to someone in an article I found, the detectors, having been installed at the same time, were now failing at the same time.
I just had a fantasy of seeking it out, finding that it is some sort of proximity bomb, and being completely blown up -- eviscerated -- and not having any clue that it happened, or would happen, save for maybe a fraction of a second of recognition, right as I see it and determine what it is, that my death is coming, living a lifetime within that moment, of course, perhaps this is it now, these last few sentences are the last of my memory of my incredibly rich and fulfilling life, the last thing I do before I go and seek it out and find it and we both blow up together and cease to exist.
But anyway, he was in there, and I had left my phone on the counter -- because I've been trying to leave the house without it sometimes, as an exercise -- and my upstairs neighbor called, or I guess texted a few times and then called, because I had completely forgotten that I had agreed to watch his shiba for the night, 
It seems silly to think now that it could have gone differently, though, that this situation at this moment in time could be not exactly what it is, me, on the floor, searching, you out of reach.
Most of the time I can recover with a quick whiff of the Carmex I keep on me this time of the year, but sometimes even that doesn't help -- the smell gets in there too deep, my eye is drawn to a sandtrap burning white in the sun, and it all comes up.
There is no time anymore for dwelling in those feelings!
In the meantime, I'm thinking about how my tongue is pressed against the roof of my mouth, and also the next array of soups I will make.
So much freedom of expression in my soup-making that sometimes I don't make any soup at all.
Sometime soon, larvae, there must be, hidden from the cold, from the fungus, barely moving.
and yet never find the time.
I watched a video about time.
There's a lot about time.
It talked about how our conception of time -- specifically, of one's own past -- has changed over the past couple of centuries.
Spending time with the worms.
I open my eyes so wide they fall out and spend time with the worms, too.
I'll bring down this building one brick at a time, but I fear my tongue will be worn through and festering before I finish licking away the first.
Once again, I feel like I've done this three times this week, not two.
That this is the third time, not the second.
I could have sworn that I did this routine three times this week.
cool kids never had the time
We forget what time it is so we never leave.
For a time, they also made instant Campbell's soup that was prepared in their patented disposable K-cups -- a successful idea fueled by market research that showed 80% of consumers who purchased Keurig pods also purchased Campbell's soup.
Thirty times seven.
Down to the bottom of the time well.
Sometimes getting the sense that the noise will swell until it consumes everything.
Sometimes getting the sense that the reward is hidden somewhere close by.
What if our limiting factor is time?
Geological time scale.
The face of someone who has done this many times before, yes, yes, I see that now.
You wave goodbye to the moon and wonder what it will look like the next time you see it -- briefly, you wonder briefly, until you forget it, whatever it was.
day time had dissolved
It's time to intend to spend time with intention.
It took me around, and it left me 4 avocados, a thing of mustard, and a bag of dill seeds richer, but the whole time it was guiding me home, back to my captors, smooth interiors and entertainment, cold, fizzy juices, regenerating supplies of ice and water - filtered for drinking, pressurized for cleaning - conditioned air, all of my favorite books, movies, games, and songs, acoustic and electronic instruments, an abundance of soft surfaces, drugs,  alcohol, and tobacco, direct connections to every single person I know and do not know, fresh meats and cheeses and seasonal vegetables and fruit, various grains, beans, nuts, oils, coffee, supplies and tools for creating with pencils, paints, words, dozens of opportunities for live voyeurism, and any number of additional goods and services on demand for impossibly fast delivery.
My favorite pastime is recognizing and articulating patterns of which I'm a part but not seeing that I'm a part of them.
If this is a journal, then I must describe what is happening, because surely some part of it is very specific to this period of time, and those parts that are not specific to this time, are specific enough that they provide some sort of sense of time transcendence to anyone reading them in the future.
Sometimes I get to the words before I get to the ideas.
Sometimes I'm looking down the street and the truck for Paul's Signs is getting a sign.
Sometimes I have a beer on the roof.
Sometimes 
I've been looking at numbers for so long I've forgotten what a word is, how words become phrases, how phrases become questions and sometimes answers, how they beg and demand, how they object, how they agree, how they cry and scream!, how they express, how they turn in on themselves, flop upside down and laugh.
Sometimes I never do.
the time in my life I felt most accepted was when I was watching this fan-made dragon ball z supercut set to a slipknot song and my older brother's friend walked past and said "dude for such a stupid show it really has awesome music" 
the time in my life I felt most rejected was when in second or third or fourth or maybe even first grade gym class we were playing hockey and the only way we were allowed to play such a wildly violent game -- what with us swinging sticks around and everything -- was with safety goggles on and we had to promise we wouldn't make fun of each other or we'd all have to stop and guess who, after five minutes of playing, somehow already forgets this important rule.
It was not sensed, it was described with words, it sat in a record, a timeline of actions and events, useful for when needing to construct a bigger timeline of actions and events, when recollecting.
Well, I guess the digression was really just this whole thing -- time to end this digression, time to gress…?
I love that feeling but haven't had one of those dreams in a long time ☹️"
Downtime!"
Dan I have to say, I haven't seen you in a long time either.
times will I ask about this day
The speaker says it exactly the same way every time, these names that are called.
I'd lie in bed at night and think about how the announcer, the one who would make announcements about which buses were arriving, would use the exact same cadence every time.
When it arrived, the announcer would say "Bus four, bus four -- " and the cadence made it seem like the announcer might and could continue saying "bus four" for eternity, but this time, no, saying it twice feels sufficient.
Two times is the amount of times required to clear all uncertainty and two times is the amount of times to be best understood.
It's been this way for a long time.
There must have been a time before.
I have this trait of my memory that when attempting to remember the conclusions to times of uncertainty I remember only the uncertainty, not the resolution.
It's the state of mind that when faced with decisions, as it is hundreds of time over every waking minute, it grabs the closest, most familiar looking decision, the one that it's made every time before.
last time we ran into each other
Can you not just smell the smell of cookies coming for Christmas time?
I've done this many, many times.
how many times 
All times it swelters and
All places swelter more with time
Sometimes I think back to my first trip across the bay.
I want to trace it, over and over again, one on each page of a notebook, and on each day, adorn a head with the structures and movements of that day's state of mind, how the roots often plant themselves in the crown and from there grow tendrils that may climb the walls of an invisible bowl, soft and searching before curling in, or might shoot and splinter or go nowhere and settle in a haze, as sometimes the roots are muddied, sometimes they do not exist, and instead a shape sits like a stone, or it floats above, open.
Pretty positive I'll only have things to gain by saying out loud -- by typing out -- the things I want to do, and instead of wallowing in their incompleteness, reveling in their reminder that I have desires, and appreciating a moment of opportunity in which I can choose to direct time and energy toward them.
Time for time spent with intention.
It's time to intend to spend time with intention.
I intend to spend this time with intention.
It is a period of time; it is not a moment.
I'll always feel like this, for a period of time.
I'll have plenty of time to find my fears.
He was very good at imbuing meta-qualities instead of setting them in the center of a stage under blinding spotlights and, at least when constructed by others, revealing them as flimsy, cardboard set-pieces built solely for this one-time show then discarded into the trash, never to continue on into anyone's life as other structures or memories.
I took notice of this feeling recently, of this recent feeling, that everything feels like a long time ago.
It makes it feel like I am distant from a lot of people, because it feels like I haven't talked to them in a long time, it makes it feel like I'm distant from places, because it's been so long since I've been there, and moments of joy and sereneness appear as hazy dots behind me, I'm going so much faster than they are, I'm speeding away, leaving them in a literal dust under couches and on top of the top shelves, in the corner no one walks in because that's where the ceilings slope downward and meet.
I guess it's just another movement in time, a contraction or expansion.
Friends, or rather acquaintances, say that in due time I'll get sick of New York and return to Philly: "You'll be back."  This is the second big curse.
If memory serves, let it serve with a sense of purpose, with plenty of time off.
I was thinking the other day about how time is circular, and here I am looking back on my writing and I see I wrote that same thought three months ago.
Well, I did feel similarly the last two times I visited my parent's house, and there they were, the same age, my dog was the same age, and it has been forever that we've been old but I've been 29 not quite 30, and still it was the same a month apart, but yet later, now, I have in fact gotten closer to 30, I am six days away, and so time does move forward, perhaps it is in spirals, doubling back on itself before moving forward.
My god when was the last time you ever encountered something you could WRITE HOME ABOUT?
I'll bet you it wasn't anytime in the last couple of years, was it?
When's the last time you wrote home?
I remember finding my room at the end of a hall and using my key to unlock the door for the first time.
Actually this is the second time I've had a dream in a few days about moving into a new place in New England.
The other time it was some odd house that was way past its prime, but had an echo of opulence.
I do kegels so that when the time comes for me to sneeze while peeing I can smoothly transition in and out of that beautiful interim of wild snot expulsion without letting the main act -- the peeing -- go off the rails.
I have learned that long walks alone, whether through cities or through woods, do more for my well being than anything else I have taken as a pastime.
I saw family members at a memorial service and thought, for maybe the first time in years, that many of them looked younger than I had remembered them.
As though every time before, when I'd see them after a while away, they'd surprise me with their aging until it became expected.
And now, time seems to have slowed down, and the aging is not apparent.
This subconscious motive was generative, and sometimes interestingly so, but the work was ultimately nothing without the context of my peers (the ultimate irony).
Turbulent times!!!
How A's opinion of B changes over time only due to A's self-changes, which allow for seeing different elements of B.
(ie texting a friend asking what time their flight gets in and they say a time but not day and you get annoyed that you are supposed to keep track of their schedule.
then another time you ask and they say the time AND include the day and you get annoyed at them for not thinking you can remember anything they've said) 
Someone feels sheepish after a day of overbearing emotion and sentimental outreach to others 
So far, it's one of those sunny winter days where you can feel both cold and warm at the same time.
In the distance I see a purple building for the first time.
And he says that they all kind of look at you funny if you try to discuss anything of real intellectual importance during moments of common downtime.
I think there may even have been a time in a meeting when I made a joke and smiled.
And I think I may still claim it -- I'll fill it in time, now that I know it's there.
Patterns do not require time.
Patterns can be singular in time, yet patterned in space.
Patterns in time are behavior.
Some have known about all of this for a long time.
Monday I had off for Veterans Day, so I took the time to read Catherine's mini-book (that's not the right word for it) and then attempt to answer some questions that she sent to me after I volunteered to speak about masculinity with her for a new essay she is working on.
I went to La Colombe (though, true story, only after going there a first time, walking in and realizing it was super busy, walking out, walking back five minutes toward another coffee shop then realizing halfway there I didn't like the vibe of that one, so I chose a place in Northern Liberties that was about a 20 minute walk away, and once I had walked there, I decided it really was La Colombe's vibe I was after for some reason -- the openness, the number of people around which I'd remain anonymous, how energizing -- so I turned around and walked all the way back to my original destination) and after reading her book and beginning to answer the questions (the book and questions are not linked, I just had recently purchased her book and wanted to read it), I got a coffee refill and continued with the questions, eventually becoming too over-caffeinated at the mind-wheel and veering off into some logical ditches that I couldn't write my way out of.
Sometimes I think surely there must be good qualities of masculinity, and I can imagine some that might be associated, but then I wonder what makes them masculine and not just non-gendered good qualities of humans.
I am more comfortable around my close friends, but even my performance around them is something that changes, not just from interaction to interaction, but over longer periods of time, from year to year, and with varying degress of my awareness.
For example, I think I was better at not giving a fuck a few years ago, and I think that was because I spent time with more feminine people who had thought about and discussed the trappings of gender.
Oops, very late this time!
I fall for my own tricks all the time.
Sometimes I wonder where all my interesting thoughts went.
Ah yes, that probably was why I can attribute so much mental growth to my college years, because yes, I was actively using my brain and engaging with things in a way that I hadn't ever before, not at such a level for such a sustained period of time.
This document scrolls down to go back in time.
You start at the top, go back in time.
The first and last were solved by the disappearance of the middle, of course, all thanks to a little bit of time.
Thank you, time.
There's a sharp curve in the diminished returns of a video game binge, and it sometimes takes me far too long to notice the drop off has long since passed.
I have moved it again, in an effort to save it, this time to the window sill in my bedroom.
Bless you little bug, you do not travel such large distances in such little time.
Some guy approached me late last night when I was sitting out front with a beer and a cigarette (pretty late, like 11, way past trick-or-treater time) and said something in Spanish -- I said "huh" before realizing it was Spanish, and he asked me "habla Espanol?" -- "ah, no, no, lo siento," -- "oh it's okay, it's okay, can I ask you a favor" as he rummages in his pockets -- my face quizzical -- "no no, not going to ask for money" -- wasn't my first guess but I hadn't ruled it out -- "some guys they think ah asking for money no I have no money no that's not what I'm asking" -- "okay yeah yeah no worries" -- he pulls out a dollar and asks for a cigarette -- "oh sure no problem, don't worry about it," gesturing away the dollar and handing him a cigarette, "do you need a lighter" -- "thank you so much, ah, lighter, yes" -- I reach into my pocket and pull out lighter as he pulls out his -- "I have lighter, thank you, thank you," he lights it and then says something about some guy in or from North Philly who might be high and maybe he doesn't want to be with him, I do not understand what he is saying -- I nod and say "ah yeah haha" and he glances at me in a way that suggests he knows I have no idea what he is saying -- "okay thank you very much, have a good night, have a blessed night you and your family" -- "thank you, you too, good bye"
I snoozed it a couple times for sure.
Though in its stead I am, of course, being a good student of pop culture and the modern American life by pouring hours into what many are claiming the greatest video game of all time, Red Dead Redemption 2.
Sometimes I think it's how absurd how I struggle to fit video games into my identity in a way that makes sense.
Would you believe me if I said I have traveled to the corners of the globe, traipsed through airport terminals, lain my eyes upon the beauties constructed through time by both human and nature alike, the streets of Shanghai, the peaks of the Alps?
The timer is going off, but it's not making a sound.
Anyway, hopefully I can give a more measured response to her questions this time.
Like I am looking at stretches of time.
Painting with a time brush.
I feel groggy all the time.
Then on Friday I struggled to wake up (a continuing struggle from last week and into this week) and somehow didn't find the time to write (though I spent a while playing guitar, mostly learning Nick Drake's Which Will), despite working for only about half an hour, before stopping around noon to pick Sara up from her half-day at work so we could leave for our New England (or rather, more New England) weekend trip.
I think I might need some alone time, too.
Some creative alone time, that is.
Not alone time during work, which saps my creativity.
But at the same time, I don't think the answer is a lot of fragments and questions; rhythms that feel like they may collapse at any moment; vocabulary that does not go beyond a first exploration of the body; quotes from modern European philosophers and literary authors; ideas from popular science headlines.
Because I had a real hard time wanting to wake up this morning and when I finally woke up and was sitting upright in my bed Sara started having an intense conversation with me via text, so, all that much later, I was very late to my usual start, which was fine but doesn't feel good.
Except maybe for that one time I had a cool job where I was teaching creative writing to kids.
Sometimes it gets a little bit better, but I generally have the feeling that I just have no reason to get up -- This American Life.
Wait wait wait, funny theory: life is intelligent (capital L Life, as a set of all living things over time) and, through its never-sated methods of propagation, it worms its way to a state where one member of its set is intelligent enough to bring back long-dead branches of itself (DNA RESURRECTION!), break onto previously impassable planes (SPACE TRAVEL!!), and even create an entirely new type of life that is broken free from the chains of life-eating-life cannibalism (AI).
"This is a scary time for young men." This is, imo, one of the most terrifying things this guy has said.
I am stuck on the possibility of meaning in my excitingly boring thoughts about how "before" and "after" are prepositions that can be used for both space and time, and how each form's meaning defines and is defined by the other's meaning.
It sort of does seem like every time I start one of these with astonishment over what time or date or day or month it is.
Astonished by time, every time I stop to notice it.
I think it would be important to learn these nuts and bolts (god help me, for I have sinned and said "nuts and bolts" once again, and YES it will be in reference to writing this time, too!) of writing, the grammarian terms.
Kevin, previous patron of and now bartender for Monkey Club, plus block neighbor with Jake]  I need to find time to write even when she is.
This was the first time I've been to a show here where they've held it upstairs, in the actual church room.
Goddamn I really do think the kids are alright but I've seen too many times now Ivy League kids who DON'T TIP A SINGLE CENT and that is so awful.
I am always ashamed to catch up with people I knew a long time ago, because inevitably I have not followed through on whatever I talked to them about before, whatever my grand plans were.
What do I do" like they're "go win games, we have to tell you one more time, go win games," and it's just not helpful."
I talked to one woman who whenever she's in a meeting at work and someonebody brings bagels or something, she doesn't want to reach for one because she's afraid someone is looking at her and thinking oh the fat lady wants to get a bagel, or ooh the fat lady is *not* having a bagel, maybe she's on a diet, she just feels very looked at all the time.
And these really negative attitudes that we have, this way o watching yourself and censoring yourself, a lot of people told me there's this idea of the "good fatty," that whenever you're in public you have to be eating a salad, you have to be smiling, you have to be on your feet all the time, it's really stressful for people and it, it puts them in this mode ---"
I suspect at some point during my eternal rest I will be sucked through time and space to a lowly court held on a barren field edged with wildfires, and through complex breathing apparatuses a small group of leathery citizens will explain that I am being charged as accomplice to the ancestors that brought this inferno.
(Write story of wealthy traveler with a strange sense of philanthropy who knowingly goes along with and encourages scams, while appearing to remain none the wiser [that is not the phrase I want goddamnit]) But at the same time, I wish I could feel more comfortable with trying to use another language.
We started out with dinner at Johnny Brenda's, then went to Lloyd's for a fancy cocktail, then went to Kosta's for a cheap drink and pool, though one of the tables was out of commission this time around and the other two were occupied the whole time, so we let that part slide.
I fell asleep multiple times.
And woke up multiple times to Sara laughing or exclaiming "Okay, what!" It was a silly movie.
This time it's half a dozen smooth rocks.
Those judgments continued, remaining slight individually (and largely absurd), and eventually began to mix with stabs of annoyance and stress from a half dozen work-related matters -- trip planning (mostly stress), perpetually broken things in the game (what is my job?), questions I could not answer from people I don't know -- and at some point they rose to a crescendo of voices, ie they were all fucking screaming at me (figuratively, mentally), and every time I tried to deal with one of them I found only an increasing volume, and so I had to lie down for a while.
Though, at the same time, the distress was real, and so I return again to one of those questions of privilege and relativity -- how is it possible to compare pain?
I care less and less about this job, and while I still want to do decent work, I'm trying to compartmentalize it as it should be, for a non-full-time, remote job.
Anything for the daytime grocery store trip.
I guess that's just better when there aren't people in your way all the time, ie when it's not busy, when it's not an evening or weekend.
That explains why I like the weekday daytime part of it, but not the actual being there part of it.
And even though I end up buying the same stuff most of the time, I will occasionally have a trip where I buy a whole bunch of new things, and that is exciting, and feels powerful.
Finding time, and the motivation, to write on the weekend is very important to the process, to me.
I don't mind that I get sucked into video games, as long as I can pull myself out at a reasonable capped time.
After a certain amount of time the joy fades and it's more of an obligation to continue (an addiction I think, for sure).
I had a real hell of a time last night.
I have taken a lot of time off.
But I do have a concern that I will be forever stuck in this phase -- writing for a short period of time each day, freeform, not actually working on anything, not improving this skill, just exercising it so it doesn't erode completely.
When I think of the times I've written things I've liked, I think of these oases of inspiration in deserts of non-writing.
So I think it'd be this (also start a spreadsheet to document!): write freeform for 15 minutes (increase over time) on normal days (e.g.
I had intrusive thoughts about others, but instead of being intrusive this time, they felt welcome, there was levity.
Sometimes it's worth just throwing out exclamations carelessly.
Heed not the chimes of passing time!
by the time
But I think the work of substance followed, and I never went there, having completed the assignment barely on time and feeling thoroughly drained already.
As an exercise in feeling fall again (feeling fall is something that used to land on me, heavy, every time it came around), maybe next time I will trace my experiences of fall and the places I was through these years.
This time not intentionally.
The scholars of which I speak cannot count the sequential (?) number of times the afternoon light (?) will hit the dark corners of the library (?) and bleach the glossy inks (!) of the books they open at last.
But they're not useful exercises, at least not right now, for this small amount of time in which I'm writing.
Agh, I forgot to set the timer again.
The last time I remember being there was probably 8 years ago, during a Thanksgiving break one of my years at Bennington.
Words are the clothes for the thoughts, this here is the runway -- but sometimes I just throw blankets over them and shove them in the spotlight.
She is a stranger for all of time, to you.
Not during this time of year, or in this part of the country.
But that was a long time ago.
Maybe that's just what happens to time when I am more mindful of moments.
Sometimes their chirr cuts off abruptly while waning, instead of completely fading out.
-- I realized I never set a timer.
Uh oh, I put on Stars of the Lid (ambient music) and I had a pang of fall for the first time.
A dizzying sadness for the passing of time.
I don't think this nostalgia is remembering times fonder than they were -- it's just feeling the distance between then and now, that itself is the sweet pain.
How does one thought sometimes provide a tunnel, or maybe a ramp, into nothingness that emerges, or lands, on a completely different thought?
I shall call my routine, disregarding the outlier coffee -- outlier in its length of time, not in necessity or importance or anything else -- the Ten Ten Fifteen.
I decided to do this fifteen minutes of writing this morning, even though I had initially (as in last night when I did the first 15 minute writing session) planned to make this a night-time activity, because I know I am planning to get a drink with a friend tonight.
I suppose it's because I have nothing else to write about, not off the top of the head, at a time uninspired.
My times uninspired have increased exponentially, I believe, from when I was younger.
That is such a short amount of time.
If I watched a cartoon that was this long, as I often do, I'd feel it has barely begun by the time it has ended.
day time had dissolved
What is the length of time between myself and the tv, I've sat too close
What is the length of time from my head to my toes?
How long, time-wise, am I?
How much time can fit in one me?
How depressing that the more times I fail, the more likely I am to fail again.
When it isn't there, that is okay, in those times it can be left alone then, wherever it is.
Things I like to do that I do many times a week
Play video games (could be less -- frequency not the problem, but sometimes the total hours is!
Spend a lot of time on the computer
Spend a lot of time in front of screens
But maybe that's just putting too much value on that which I can't understand -- the changes which take place over long periods of time.
